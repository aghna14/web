== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add this to your site =

The easiest way is just to add a page and use the shortcode.

If you want to add this somewhere else on your site, like header, footer, sidebar, etc, then probably the easiest way is to go to Appearance, Widgets, and place a text widget somewhere in your layout, and use the shortcode in that. For this to work, you will need to use a plugin that will enable shortcodes in widgets. This is handy to have, not just for this plugin but for all your plugins. Do a google search, you will find plenty of resources explaining how to achieve this. Good luck!
